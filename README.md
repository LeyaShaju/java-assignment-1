# java-assignment-1

aim:

To create a game where play picks to cards, if they match the they get a point, the goal is to get all the cards to match.

what my program needs to do

- to randomly allocate cards to in a x by x format.
- to select two cards and determine if they match
    - if not they place flip them facing down again
- To say “you win” when all cards are paired

- bonus for me:
    - implement a limit to the number of failed tries


My plan-
    the card format will be a 4 by 4 and it will be based to colour matches, so in total 16 cards and 8 pairs.To start.

Leanred how to implement an image as a button

Summary: Initially I struggled to setup my github, I couldn't figure out hwo to obtain and gpg key and had to research. Eventually figuring it out I started with learning how to make buttons and a gui frame slowly implementing other features to like images and making a 4 by 4 grid layout. Although I struggled with making multiple buttons, I realised it's basically making and array and using the for loop which i have experience with in python, that being said Java is a lot less straightforward. Ending today with a 4 by 4 grid layout with a total of 16 cards.

With help of websites like stack overflow and prior knowledge, I learned how to operate the action performed. My plan is to make whilst the buttons are being created in the for loop I will randomly assign it an attribute in pairs.
