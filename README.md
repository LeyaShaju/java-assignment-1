# java-assignment-1

aim:

To create a game where play picks to cards, if they match the they get a point, the goal is to get all the cards to match.

what my program needs to do

- to randomly allocate cards to in a x by x format.
- to select two cards and determine if they match
    - if not they place flip them facing down again
- To say “you win” when all cards are paired

- bonus for me:
    - implement a limit to the number of failed tries


My plan-
    the card format will be a 4 by 4 and it will be based to colour matches, so in total 16 cards and 8 pairs.To start.
